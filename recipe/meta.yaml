  summary: COIN-OR Utilities (CoinUtils)
  description: |
    CoinUtils (Coin-OR Utilities) is an open-source collection of classes and
    functions that are generally useful to more than one COIN-OR project. These
    utilities include:

      - classes for storing and manipulating sparse matrices and vectors,
      - performing matrix factorization,
      - parsing input files in standard formats, e.g. MPS,
      - building representations of mathematical programs,
      - performing simple presolve operations,
      - warm starting algorithms for mathematical programs, and
      - comparing floating point numbers with a tolerance, among others.
